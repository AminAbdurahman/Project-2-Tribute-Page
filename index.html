  <div id="tribute-info">The Internet has been here since January 1st, 1983.  There were no restrictions at the time and was an environment that was open to run but it had it's limitations at the time.  Without the individuality of the website users adding to the experience, the websites and communities will become dead.  However, nowadays despite being so large and successful, there are huge portions of the internet where you aren't free to say what you want to say despite no intentions to hurt anyone due to a multitude of reasons.  Let's first start with the main topics I want to inform you about.

    <h3 id="subtitle">Why Does The Internet Exist?</h3>
    <p id="description"> As stated before, the internet was originally created on January 1st, 1983, however no one could access it until April 30th, 1993.  The main purpose of the internet was during the year 1969 for academic purposes and file sharing for businesses.  Thanks to the man "Tim Berners-Lee", the idea of the World Wide Web finally became a reality after two decades of work and innovation.  Many social media websites started to spring off in the late 1990s, some failed to keep thriving and new ones showed up every year.  During the first decade of the 21st century was the golden age of the internet and the only issues at the time were the loading time and the small communities hosted by the people that had passions for what they wanted in the internet. </p>

      <h4 id="tribute-info">Internet Censorship<h4>
        <p id="description"> The first case of Internet Censorship actually dates back to 1995 where a man named "Chris Lamprecht" got banned from using the internet for being a hacker.  Soon after many acts were passed that limited people from what they could do online and applied consequences for certain actions through the internet.</p>

        <div id="quote">
          <p id="description">"Theoretically, ISPs can block certain websites from view. However, net neutrality would mandate that ISPs can’t favor any particular company or website in the U.S. Without net neutrality, ISPs could charge a fee for usage of bandwidth, meaning that those websites will load faster. However, some people argue that this is a form of censorship, and it’s a topic widely debated in the U.S, but more on that a bit later."<a href="https://www.security.org/vpn/internet-censorship/">-Aliza Vigderman</a></p>
